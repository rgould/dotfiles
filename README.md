This is my castle. [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) makes it easy to use the same dotfiles across many environments.

If you you want to use my (public) dotfiles, follow these steps:

`gem install homesick`

`homesick clone git@github.com:rgould/dotfiles.git`

`homesick symlink dotfiles`

Think I should be using some smart trick that you know of? [Email me](mailto:rwgould@gmail.com)
